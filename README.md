# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Nischal Thapa**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Game of Thrones Character** is an android app that **displays a random character with their title and name from the Game of Thrones API. it can be used to fetch a charater's picture and name from the show.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **😎🤘🏽👑**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
- I added the title and name of the characters with the image from the API.
## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://thronesapi.com/**.
